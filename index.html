    <ul>
      <li>
African penguins are fast swimmers, allowing them to catch a variety of prey from the sea, including sardines, anchovies, squid, and crustaceans.
    </li>
    <li>
    One of the African penguin's most distinctive features is a small pink gland above each eye, which helps them cope with high temperatures in South Africa.
  </li>
  <li>When African penguin chicks hatch, the parents share the responsibility of keeping them warm and fed constantly for the first 30 days.</li>
<li>They also have a number of dot-like markings flecked across their white chests. These flecks help to individualize each penguin, as each penguin's feather pattern is as individual as a human's fingerprints.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h5>However all these unique qualities of the African penguin have not protected them from endangerment.</h5>
<p>African penguin populations have plummeted. While breeding pairs may have numbered in the millions in the early 20th century, less than 42,000 individuals remain today. Habitat loss, over-fishing, and coastal development are taking a toll. </p>
